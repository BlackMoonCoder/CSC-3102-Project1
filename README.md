# CSC-3102-Project1
In this project I completed the implementation of a parametric Priority Queue abstract data type (ADT) that uses a binary heap in its implementation. The program reads a list of dates, in the format mm/dd/yyyy, from a text file whose name is entered as a command line argument and an integer code representing the way the comparator should work, inserts the dates into an initially empty heap and then performs a series of deletions to empty the heap. The program will then generate a list of the dates in the order specified by the sort-code by displaying the dates as they are removed from the heap. The sort-codes corespond to their repective keys: -2 is -month-day-year, -1 is -year-month-day, 0 is +weekDayNumber+monthName+day+year, 1 is +year+month+day, 2 is +month+day+year. The - denotes descending order and + denotes ascending order in the sort key. For example, the sort key +year+month+day means that the dates will be sorted using the year in ascending order as the primary key, month number in ascending order as the secondary key, and day in ascending order as the tertiary key.
